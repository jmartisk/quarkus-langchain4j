# Sample chatbot using advanced RAG and a SQL database

![Movie Muse](moviemuse.png)

Set your OpenAI API key into the `QUARKUS_LANGCHAIN4J_OPENAI_API_KEY`
environment variable. Then, run the example by executing `mvn quarkus:dev`
and open `localhost:8080` in your browser and start chatting.

The chatbot uses a SQL database with information about movies with their
basic metadata (the database is populated with data from
`src/main/resources/data/movies.csv` at startup). When you ask a question, an
LLM is used to generate SQL queries necessary for answering your question.
Check the application's log, the SQL queries and the retrieved data will be
printed there.

# Switching to a local model (codellama) instead of OpenAI

Install Ollama per instructions in https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-langchain4j/dev/ollama.html
And run the `codellama` model (`ollama run codellama`).
Then run the application with `mvn quarkus:dev -Dollama`
